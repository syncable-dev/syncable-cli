//! Live cluster analysis for Kubernetes resources.
//!
//! This module provides real-time analysis by connecting to a Kubernetes cluster
//! and optionally Prometheus for historical metrics.

// Re-export from parent module's files (temporary - will be moved here)
// These will be moved to analyzer.rs, metrics.rs, prometheus.rs in a future refactor
