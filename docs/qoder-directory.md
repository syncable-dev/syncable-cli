# .qoder Directory

## Overview

The `.qoder` directory contains development artifacts generated during the development process of the syncable-cli project. These files are not part of the released code and should be ignored by version control.

## Contents

The directory typically contains:

- Quest files (design documents) in `.qoder/quests/`
- Rule files in `.qoder/rules/`

## Purpose

These files are generated by the Qoder IDE during development to store:

1. Quest files - Development tasks and implementation guides
2. Rules files - Project-specific coding rules and constraints

## Version Control

The `.qoder` directory and all its contents are intentionally ignored in version control through the `.gitignore` file. This ensures that:

1. Development artifacts don't clutter the repository
2. Developer-specific configurations are not shared
3. The release process is not affected by uncommitted changes

## Git Ignore Patterns

The following patterns in `.gitignore` ensure proper ignoring of the directory:

```gitignore
.qoder/
.qoder/*
.qoder/**/*
```

These patterns ensure that all files and subdirectories within the `.qoder` directory are ignored by Git.
